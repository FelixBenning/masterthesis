\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
    
Besides my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Leif DÃ¶ring, I also want to thank my colleagues
at the faculty for mathematics I could bounce ideas and problems off. For proof
reading I want to thank Katharina Enin, Julie Naegelen and especially Linda
Ritzau for their numerous suggestions and corrections.
