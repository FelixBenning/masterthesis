\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
    
I want to thank my colleagues at the Faculty for Mathematics, in particular
my supervisor Prof. Dr. Leif DÃ¶ring, for the helpful discussions and their open
ears to bounce ideas off of.
For proof reading I want to thank Katharina Enin, Julie Naegelen and especially
Linda Ritzau for their numerous suggestions and corrections.
