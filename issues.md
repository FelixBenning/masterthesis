# Operatornorm of Momentum Transformation

- [ ] Basis Change to Jordan normal form
	- [x] Bound J^n
	- [ ] Bound Basis Change
- [ ] Schur decomposition / QR decomposition
	- [ ] explicit decomposition to find value in the corner
	- [ ] same idea as bounding J^n just that the basis is no problem this time as it is orthogonal
- [ ] Constrained Optimization (Lagrange) OR spectrum AA^t OR A^tA spektrum
	- [ ] Bound ||A^2||
	- [ ] Bound ||A||^2
	- Apply Kozyakin
